"""The application itself, in a real window, on whichever platform runs this.

The e2e tier drives `libera --serve` with headless Chromium, which is the
editor and the bridge but not the window. What ships is pywebview on WKWebView
(macOS), WebKitGTK (Linux) or WebView2 (Windows), and a difference between
those engines has already reached a user: see
`tests/c_e2e/host/test_file_menu.py`, where the editor lost Save As in WebKit
and never in Chromium.

So this tier launches the shipped CLI, lets it open real windows, and reads
what each window's own page photographed of its canvas (`libera --shot`, armed
per session in `editor.serve_bridge`). Measuring the picture that way needs no
screenshot utility and no screen-recording permission: the page posts it to
the host, which writes it where `--shot` said.

Two things make this safe to run on a machine somebody is using:

- Every launch gets a home of its own, so it cannot find the user's running
  Libera Suite and hand its documents to it (`instance.hand_off`), and leaves
  no state, no config and no Recent list behind.
- The tier is skipped unless a run asks for it by marker (the root conftest)
  and unless this platform can put a window on screen.

It takes the focus while it runs, which is the one cost of testing a window.
