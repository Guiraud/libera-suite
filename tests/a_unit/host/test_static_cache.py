"""Payload files are revalidated before a browser reuses them.

WebView2 keeps one HTTP cache for the origin, 127.0.0.1:43110, whatever
payload is behind it. With nothing but a Last-Modified header it reused its
copy of AllFonts.js from the previous payload without asking: a freshly
installed payload with 32 web fonts was driven by an index of 188, the editor
asked for fonts that were not there, and the document never rendered.

Modification time cannot settle it either -- archives keep their files' times,
so two payloads can serve the same name with the same Last-Modified -- hence an
ETag over the file's full path, size and nanosecond mtime.
