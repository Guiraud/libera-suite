"""A document someone else has open, opened in the editor.

The editor has a mode for it, which the host has to switch on before the
document is ready: it marks the document read-only and says so, then lets you
edit, and expects the host to send a plain Save to Save As, because the file
belongs to whoever holds the lock. Without it a document open in LibreOffice
opened here as if nobody else had it.
