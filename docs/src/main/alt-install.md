# Other ways to install

[Install](install.md) has the usual way in for each platform, which suits most people. This page is for everything else: choosing a channel yourself, installing by hand, and knowing where things go.

## The install script's options

`install.sh` takes options. Piped, it needs `sh -s --` in front of them:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://cdn.abilian.com/libera/install.sh | sh -s -- --prefix ~/apps
curl -fsSL https://cdn.abilian.com/libera/install.sh | bash -s -- --help
```

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--prefix DIR` | install somewhere else (default: `~/.local`) |
| `--channel pip` | on Linux, install the Python package even when Flatpak is there |
| `--no-payload` | install the command now, download the components later |
| `--origin URL` | download from somewhere other than the public server |

It writes to `~/.local/bin` and `~/.local/share` and nowhere else. Open its URL in a browser to read it before running it.

## pipx or uv

Libera Suite is on PyPI as `libera`, and needs Python 3.12 or newer. On macOS and Windows:

```sh
uv tool install libera      # or: pipx install libera
libera --payload-install
```

To try it without installing it, `uvx libera` runs it from a cache; the first run offers to download the components.

On Linux, the window is drawn by GTK, whose Python bindings come from your distribution and are built for its own Python. An isolated environment cannot see them, so `pipx` needs two flags:

```sh
pipx install --python /usr/bin/python3 --system-site-packages libera
libera --payload-install
```

Without them, Libera Suite installs cleanly and then opens no window. `uv tool` has no equivalent of `--system-site-packages`, so on Linux use `pipx`. The first run of `libera` names any GTK packages your distribution is missing; it knows apt, dnf, pacman and zypper.

## The Flatpak, by hand

This is what the install script does when Flatpak is present:

```sh
arch=amd64     # or arm64, for your machine
ver=$(curl -fsSL https://cdn.abilian.com/libera/bundles/latest)
# on arm64: ver=0.4.1, the last version built for it
curl -fLO "https://cdn.abilian.com/libera/bundles/libera-$ver-$arch.flatpak"
flatpak install --user "./libera-$ver-$arch.flatpak"
flatpak run eu.liberasuite.Libera
```

`bundles/latest` holds the current version number, so these lines stay valid from one release to the next. The bundle, about 70 MB, contains the components. It runs on the GNOME runtime, which `flatpak` downloads from Flathub the first time; a machine without the Flathub remote needs it added first:

```sh
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

## The components {#the-editors}

The Windows installer and the Flatpak include the components. Every other channel downloads them once, after the application. `libera` offers to the first time it runs; this does it explicitly:

```sh
libera --payload-install
```

It downloads about 90 MB from `cdn.abilian.com` and checks every file against fingerprints that came inside the application, stopping at the first that disagrees. It then builds a font index for your machine, which takes a moment.

To install components you built yourself, or were given, point it at their directory:

```sh
libera --payload-install --from /path/to/artifacts
```

[Build the components](../develop/build.md) explains how to build them. `libera --payload-remove` deletes them again; they take about 350 MB on disk.

## Where things live

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/libera/`, or `~/.local/share/libera/` |
| Linux, Flatpak | `~/.var/app/eu.liberasuite.Libera/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Libera Suite/` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Libera Suite\` |

The components sit under `payload/<version>/` there. An update puts a new version beside the old one, and Libera Suite removes an old one once nothing has used it for four weeks: Libera Suite installed another way on the same account may still be running on it. `libera --payload-status` lists them, with when each was last used. To use components from somewhere else, a local build for instance, set `LIBERA_PAYLOAD` to their directory; it overrides everything above.

## A launcher entry on Linux

The install script and the Flatpak both put Libera Suite in your applications menu. After any other install, this does the same, for your account alone: an icon, *Open With*, and documents that open on a double-click.

```sh
libera --launcher-install
libera --launcher-remove     # to take it out again
```

## A double-clickable application on macOS

After a Homebrew, `pipx` or `uv tool` install, this builds `~/Applications/Libera.app` for your account: an icon in Launchpad and the Dock, *Open With* in Finder, and documents that open on a double-click.

```sh
libera --launcher-install
libera --launcher-remove     # to take it out again
```

It compiles a small launcher, so it needs the Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`), which Homebrew already installed. The application runs the Python of the install that built it: after reinstalling Libera Suite somewhere else, run `libera --launcher-install` again. A Homebrew upgrade needs nothing.

From a source checkout you can also build one with the build script:

```sh
build/macos/macos-app.sh          # builds build/out/Libera.app
open build/out/Libera.app
```

It opens documents on a double-click and shows the Libera icon in the Dock. It runs the Python it was built with, so it belongs to that checkout: leave it there, and rebuild it if the checkout moves. It is not signed, so the first launch says **"cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"**. On macOS 15 and later, the way past it is *System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Open Anyway*.
