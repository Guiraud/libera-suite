"""Building the parts of a payload that can only be built here.

Installing is not unpacking. `AllFonts.js` records absolute font paths and
`DoctRenderer.config` absolute payload paths, so both have to be produced on
this machine by running `allfontsgen` out of the payload just unpacked --
which is also why the artifacts ship font *sources* rather than the web set.
