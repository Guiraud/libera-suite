"""The payload manifest: which artifacts make a payload, their sizes and hashes,
and the source they were built from.

One definition for everyone who reads or writes it. build/engine/dist.sh writes it
(`python3 -m libera.manifest stamp`), `lb release` reads it before publishing,
and the installer verifies every download against the copy shipped in the
wheel, which is what makes the origin untrusted storage. Each used to have its
own idea of the format.

Python 3.10 and the standard library only, on purpose: dist.sh runs inside the
build container, Ubuntu 22.04, whose Python is 3.10, and imports this from the
checkout with nothing installed. Hence also its place, at the top of `libera`
and not under `libera.payload`, whose __init__ imports tomllib (3.11). ruff's
target-version holds the syntax to 3.10; nothing holds the library to it, so
check what you import. See notes/plans/build-tooling.md.

# `libera_commit` has the same gap from the other side: it is a sourcehut SHA,
# which a stranger cannot resolve, because the GitHub mirror is a filtered push
# whose SHAs differ. See "Where this lives" in CLAUDE.md.
