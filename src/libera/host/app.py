"""Starting the application: the server, the first windows, the menu bar.

The top of the host: the only module that may touch every layer below it.

It exists because of a cycle. `run()` used to live in `window.py`, which meant
window reached *up* to `menu` to install the menu bar -- while `menu` reached
down to window for the front window. Six function-level imports held the two
apart; a function-level import is a circular dependency that somebody has
worked around.

Putting the runner above both leaves every import pointing one way. See

    loop returned on its first iteration and every document after the first was
    created while the GUI loop did not yet exist. The comment above it stated
    the requirement it was failing to meet: a window created before `start()`
    has run is never shown. Whether it appeared came down to a race against
    `webview.start()` on the main thread, which `open_window` usually lost by a
    conversion's worth of time -- which is why this mostly worked.

    It is the same bug as `_install_menu`, from the same cause, and
    `notes/lessons-learned/threads.md` is about exactly this: a docstring is
    not a test, so read the condition and the sentence next to each other and
    ask whether one implies the other.

    `shown` fires from the GUI loop with the window on screen, so unlike a list
    that `create_window` fills, it cannot be set before `start()`. It is also
    what pywebview waits on for the same job: `start()`'s own `_create_children`
    blocks on `windows[0].events.shown` before creating the rest.

    Losing the race costs the window itself.
    `start()` runs `_initialize` over `windows`, then snapshots `windows[1:]`
    for that thread, then enters the GUI loop; a window appended between the
    snapshot and the loop is never created, and one appended between the two
    earlier steps is created without being initialised. Waiting for `shown`
    puts every later document after all three, which is the only state with one
    outcome.
