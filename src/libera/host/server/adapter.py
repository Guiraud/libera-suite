"""The one module that knows the web framework.

Bottle, which pywebview already depends on, so it costs nothing to ship. This
module copies what an endpoint needs out of Bottle's request into a
`api.Request`, finds the endpoint in `routes`, and turns the
`api.Response` it returns into Bottle's. Bottle's own `request` belongs to
the thread serving it -- the shape every thread bug in this host had -- so it is
read here and nowhere else, and `tests/a_unit/host/test_layering.py` holds that.
Swapping the framework changes this module alone.
