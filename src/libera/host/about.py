"""Who wrote what, in one place, for everything that has to say so.

Three surfaces need the same sentences and used to hold their own copy: the
editor's own About panel (through the theme's `attribution` token, which is
build-time and lives in `build/payload/theme/libera/meta/config.json`), the macOS About
panel (through `NSHumanReadableCopyright`), and Help > About on Linux. A fourth,
`--payload-status`, prints the revisions rather than the prose.

Keeping the text here rather than at each call site is not tidiness. The
attribution is the one string in this application that has to be *correct*
rather than merely present: it names somebody else's work, says the build is
modified, and names the licence that requires both. Three copies drift, and the
copy that drifts is the one nobody reads until it matters.

**"includes components from", not "is based on".** The host is ours and original;
what comes from upstream is the editor payload. "Based on" invites the reading
that the whole application is a derivative of theirs, which overstates their
claim and understates ours. The payload genuinely is a modified AGPL work, and
that is what these lines say.

The layer below every other: this module imports nothing from the host, so
anything may read it.
