"""AppKit: windows and dialogs as macOS draws them.

One of the three toolkit modules `windows` chooses between, each a
`portable.Toolkit`. Read on macOS alone, so AppKit is imported once, here.

It also starts the application the way AppKit wants it started: prepare()
before anything exists, complete_startup() once the menu bar does, which is where
Finder's "open documents" events start being answered.

AppKit is main-thread-only, while most of what puts something on screen
arrives on a request thread. `run_on_gui_thread` hands work over; an alert
expects to be called there already, and the save panel hands itself over,
because it waits for a completion handler.

    Outside `Libera.app` the running process's main bundle is the interpreter's

    developer running `libera` got "About Python" and "Hide Python" in the
    application menu, and "Python" as the bold item in the menu bar.

    The main bundle's info dictionary is mutable and both names come out of it,
    so setting them fixes the menu at the source: AppKit builds the titles from
    the right name. The fix this replaced corrected the titles item by item
    afterwards, and only ever reached the ones someone had thought of.
    Measured after the change: "Libera" in the menu bar, "About
    Libera" in the menu, and "Libera Suite" from `lsappinfo` and from another
    process's `NSRunningApplication.localizedName()`.

    **The one constraint is to run before
    `NSApplication.sharedApplication()`.** Measured: the same two lines after
    the shared application exists change nothing at all, not even before
    `setActivationPolicy_`. So this runs from prepare(), ahead of
    `webview.start()`, and cannot move into complete_startup() with the rest
    of the start-up work.

    Both keys, mirroring `build/macos/macos-app.sh`'s Info.plist: CFBundleName is the
    menu bar, CFBundleDisplayName is what the system reports elsewhere. Inside
    the bundle both already hold these values, so this is a no-op there.

    **Nothing here can fix the Dock tile's name.** That name
    is the bundle's *filename* on disk, which for us is `Python.app` and is not
    ours to rename. Measured against the tile itself, three ways: this change
    leaves it at "Python"; the private `_LSSetApplicationInformationItem` sets
    the LaunchServices display name, which is already "Libera Suite" and which
    the tile ignores; and the same build launched as `Libera.app` reads
    "Libera", as `Libera Suite.app` reads "Libera Suite". The icon has an
    override (`_wear_the_application_icon`) because AppKit messages the Dock
    for that one; the name has no counterpart. A bundle is the answer.

    **Check any of this from outside the process.** Every reading available
    in here lies in both directions:
    `NSRunningApplication.currentApplication()` reports the dictionary it was
    just handed whether or not it took, `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication()`
    reported "Python" for a run whose menu bar was on screen saying Libera, and
    `lsappinfo` reported "Libera Suite" for a run whose Dock tile said Python.
    For the tile, ask the Dock:

        osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "Dock"
                      to get name of every UI element of list 1'
