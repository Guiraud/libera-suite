"""GTK: how Linux asks a question. Everything else is pywebview's.

One of the three toolkit modules `windows` chooses between, each a
`portable.Toolkit`; `portable` supplies all of it here but the two calls
that put a message on screen.

PyGObject is imported only where a dialog is built. It is a system package, so
it can be missing wherever this module is merely imported (the test tier,
`libera --serve` on a headless box), and only a question on screen needs it.
