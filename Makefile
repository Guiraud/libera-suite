lint: lint-py lint-js ## ruff, ty, pyrefly, mypy on src, plus biome on the bridge JS

# The type checkers run once per platform, wherever `make lint` runs.
#
# `sys.platform` is a fact at check time: a checker prunes the branches for
# every other platform before looking at them, and reports an attribute that
# only exists elsewhere -- `os.startfile`, `ctypes.windll`, `pwd` -- as missing.
# So each machine used to lint clean on code that failed on the others. Three
# rounds of it reached main from Windows (SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE, then four
# `startfile`/`windll` reads), and one went the other way unseen: `pwd` in a
# path Windows reaches, which only ran because a swallowed ImportError hid it.
#
# Each checker spells the flag and the platform its own way, hence three lists.
# About five seconds for all nine, against one for three.
# The application, and the build tooling (build/src/libera_build).

# --- tests -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Markers come from the directory (see tests/conftest.py). The upper two levels
# skip rather than fail when there is no payload or no browser; the e2e tier's
# browser is `uv run playwright install chromium`, once.

test: ## the whole suite (~4 min); `uv run pytest` takes its options
	uv run pytest

test-unit: ## fast and isolated; needs no payload and no browser
	uv run pytest -m unit

test-integration: ## the host over HTTP; needs an installed payload
	uv run pytest -m integration

test-e2e: ## the editor in headless Chromium; needs a payload and a browser
	uv run pytest -m e2e

# Real windows, on this platform: skipped by every other run, because they
# take the focus while they are up. On Linux they need a display --
# `lb linux gui-test` brings an Xvfb one.
test-gui: ## the application in a real window, in the engine that ships
	uv run pytest -m gui

# --- docs --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The site is its own deployment and no part of `ship`: it carries no version,
# refers to no artifact by hash, and a typo in it should not wait for a release.

docs: ## build the documentation site, failing on a broken link
	$(MAKE) -C docs check

docs-serve: ## preview the documentation site
	$(MAKE) -C docs serve

docs-publish: ## deploy the documentation site to docs.liberasuite.eu
	$(MAKE) -C docs publish

# --- packaging ---------------------------------------------------------------

# NB: never put `build` in this list. build/ is the Euro-Office build scripts
# and the patch queue, not an artefact directory -- uv_build writes dist/ and
# nothing else. `rm -rf build` here used to delete 25 patches and 1100 lines of
# shell every time someone ran `make build`, and a later `git pull` does not
# bring a deleted working tree back: `git restore build/` does.
clean: ## remove Python caches and dist/
	rm -rf .pytest_cache .ruff_cache dist __pycache__ .mypy_cache \
