  <!-- The macOS half of src/libera/launcher.desktop, and the two are meant to
       stay the same set: one entry per format host/apps.py routes to an
       editor and the system has a name for. This declared Words alone, so
       macOS never offered to open a .xlsx or a .pptx that Libera Suite opens
       perfectly well -- the Linux entry had claimed all three since it was
       written. Measured both ways against
       NSWorkspace.URLsForApplicationsToOpenURL_: before, .docx yes and .xlsx
       and .pptx no; after, all three.

       Every identifier here was read out of the system rather than
       remembered, by asking UTType.typeWithFilenameExtension_ for each
       extension in apps.py. Two of its answers are deliberately not used.
       "org.libreoffice.visio-document" for .vsdx comes from LibreOffice being
       installed on the machine that asked, not from macOS, so claiming it
       would be claiming another application's type; Visio is therefore the one
       format the .desktop declares and this does not. And
       "com.microsoft.word.doc" is left out with it: .doc opens and cannot be
       saved, so offering to edit one leads somewhere Save does not go.

       One dict per editor rather than per format, because Open With shows
       CFBundleTypeName and "Spreadsheet" is more use there than four entries
       each naming one extension. -->
