# Run on the machine that has the release installed. From a Mac, which can run
# none of this itself, `lb release released-gui` copies it to every Linux
# builder (or --on one), runs it, and fetches the screenshots into build/out/.
# A builder missing the tools says so, with the line that installs them, and
# is not counted as a pass.
#
# `lb linux gui` does this from the build tree, in the test container. It
# proves the code opens a window; it says nothing about the artifact anybody
# downloads, which on Linux is a Flatpak whose GTK and WebKit come from the
# GNOME runtime rather than from the distribution. That is a different WebKit,
# and it is the one users get.
#
# Run it on the machine that has the release installed. It needs no checkout
# and no payload of its own -- the bundle carries its editors, and the blank it
# opens is taken out of whatever the application says its payload is.
#
# **Two failures look identical from outside and both are checked**: a window
# that never appears, and a window that appears empty because the editor did
# not load in it. The second is the interesting one, and a script that stopped
# at "the process is still running" would call it a pass.
#
# Requires: xvfb-run, xwininfo, and ImageMagick (`import` and `identify`).
# Deliberately not scrot and PIL, which is what build/test-linux/gui-smoke.py
# uses: those are in the test image, and this has to run on a plain host.
