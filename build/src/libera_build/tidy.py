"""`lb tidy`: remove every build on this machine.

Two places hold builds and both go: the repository, where the Flatpak's
builddir and ostree store are the bulk of it, and $BUILD_ROOT, which is the
payload, the native core and the Linux container trees. On the laptop this was
written on that is 1.4 GB and 44 GB.

$BUILD_ROOT/src goes too. It is a clone of the upstream repositories at the
pinned SHAs, so a build input rather than a build -- but it lives in the build
area, `lb payload fetch` recreates it, and leaving 6.5 GB behind after a
command called tidy would be its own surprise.

**Dry by default.** Not a guard against the person who typed it: they asked.
It is that this deletes a day of V8, ICU and container builds, and seeing the
list first costs one extra word: --yes.
