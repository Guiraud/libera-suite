"""`lb linux`: this repository's checks on Linux, in a container.

Everything about Libera Suite is verified on a Mac, and this is the one place
the host, the bridge and the editor are exercised on Linux at all. Two
containers already build things (the payload and the Flatpak) and neither runs
a test from tests/; this one does.

`test` and `gui` cover different halves and neither subsumes the other. The
suite drives `libera --serve` with headless Chromium, which is the editor and
the bridge but not the window; `gui` opens the window pywebview actually builds
on Linux -- GTK 3 and WebKitGTK, a stack that exists nowhere on macOS.

The scripts that run *inside* the container stay shell: running uv, pytest
and xvfb-run in a Debian image is what shell is for. What moved here is
everything around them: the engine, the image, the volumes, which payload.

# UV_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3 (in the Dockerfile) and the pyvenv.cfg line
# together, because neither works alone. PyGObject is not a wheel -- it is the
# distribution's /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/gi -- so an environment built on
# a downloaded interpreter can never reach it whatever else is set, and one
# built on the system interpreter still cannot until system site-packages are
# switched on. Without both, gui.is_gtk_available() is False in here and every
# test that opens a window is testing the wrong machine. This is the same trap
# a user meets: `pipx install libera` reports no window on a box with every GTK
# package installed, and `pipx install --system-site-packages libera` reports
# one. gui.py says so.

# With a mounted payload the status check passes and nothing is installed;

# into the venv volume, so this is a download once and a no-op after.

# reads no payload. It used to install one all the same, and so stopped the
