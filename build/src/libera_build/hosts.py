"""Reaching a machine: run a script on it, send it a commit, fetch a file.

Two kinds. `SshHost` is a builder over ssh. `LocalHost` is a builder in a
directory of this machine, whose `~` is that directory: the integration tests
drive it as a real builder, with real bash and real git, and no mocks.

Over ssh an exit status describes the shell, including its login and logout
scripts, rather than the work: a login bash returns 1 from `set -eu; exit 0`,
because ~/.bash_logout runs with -u still in force (see
notes/lessons-learned/scripts-and-builds.md). So a script run on a host prints
the facts it wants believed as KEY=value lines, MARK=... among them, and the
caller reads those.

# it as one path that does not exist (measured on the Windows builder).
