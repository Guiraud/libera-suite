"""`lb app flatpak`: the Flatpak, built in a container.

All of it runs in a container, Mac included: flatpak-builder is an ordinary
Linux program, and what it needs is user namespaces and /dev/fuse, which Docker
grants. The bundle is built, installed and run in there: `check` asks the
application whether it could open a window, `smoke` has it convert a document
with the payload it carries. The window itself is `lb linux gui`'s job.

Bundles cannot be cross-built: flatpak-builder runs every module inside
bubblewrap, whose seccomp filter is built for the architecture it runs on. So
each is built on a machine of its own architecture (notes/15-builders.md).
