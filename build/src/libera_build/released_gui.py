"""`lb release released-gui`: does what users download open a window?

`lb linux gui` opens one from the build tree, in the test container: it proves
the code opens a window and says nothing about the artifact anybody downloads,
which on Linux is a Flatpak whose GTK and WebKit come from the GNOME runtime
rather than the distribution. A different WebKit, and the one users get.

This Mac has no flatpak, no Xvfb and no X server, so it asks machines that can.
build/install/released-gui.sh is what runs there, and it stays shell: it is copied to
a builder and run with no checkout and no payload of its own, like install.sh
on a user's machine. This is the half that drives it: which machines, the copy,
the verdict, the screenshot back.
